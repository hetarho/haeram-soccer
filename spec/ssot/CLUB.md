# CLUB Squad and growth
> r1 | Define the implemented browser-demo behavior for squad and growth.

## decisions
- CLUB-1 [o] A club starts with 18 players, a suitable manager, small facilities, 800 supporters, and a complete starting XI.
- CLUB-2 [o] Player attributes include attack, passing, defense, keeper, stamina, potential, birth year, wage, contract term, and reputation; overall derives from role.
- CLUB-3 [o] Players age using the game calendar, develop through age/potential/manager ability, decline after 30, retire at 36, and are replaced by generated youth.
- CLUB-4 [o] Recruitment offers immediate contributors, prospects, free agents, and short-term loans; selling produces money and removes the player from selection.
- CLUB-5 [o] Transfer price, recurring wage, and term are shown before acceptance. Keep at least 14 players and one goalkeeper; maximum squad size is 26.
- CLUB-6 [o] Starting lineup is the best available role fit under the applied formation. Rotation and fatigue affect observed matches without mandatory per-player administration.
- CLUB-7 [o] Promotion, supporters, facilities, managers, player generations and finance measure growth; history survives transfers and retirement.
- CLUB-8 [o] Facility investment has a stated price and improves development/reach; actions fail cleanly if cash is insufficient.

## flow
- Play: validated input → deterministic outcome → recorded facts → visible feedback.
